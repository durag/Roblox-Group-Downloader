No, this does not steal your cookie. The beauty of this code is that it's open-source. Inspect it, learn it, and familiarize yourself with it.
## Setup
  - To start, run "requirements.bat" to install all the package requirements to make the script function as its supposed to.
  - Next, edit "main.py" and change the URL on line 11 to the shop URL Check #Configurations for help.
  - Lastly, run "start.bat" to run the code or if you prefer you can paste in Command Prompt "python main.py"
## Configuration
1. For configuration, just replace the URL variable with the groups ***SEE ALL*** page. Not just their group link. When you look at a group's store there should be a button called **See All ->**.

2. Once you are on the See All page copy the link which should look something like this: __https://www.roblox.com/catalog?Category=1&CreatorName=GROUPNAME&CreatorType=Group__

3. After you have set your link run the script and it will download all of the clothes.

## Features
  - Auto-downloads a group's entire clothing catalog
  - aves the exact shirt/pants name, as well as accounting for duplicate titles 
  - Saves to File titled "clothes"
  - Displays save output by filename
